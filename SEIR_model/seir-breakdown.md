## Model Structure

### Parameters

-   $\epsilon$: Rate of Infection (How long it takes to move from Exposed to Infected)
-   $\omega$: Waning of Immunity
-   $b$:
-   $\mu$: probability of transition given contact
-   $\gamma$: recovery rate for asymptomatic
-   $\alpha$: infection induced death rate
-   $c$: rate of contact between groups
-   $S_s$: scale susceptibility $\rightarrow$ people with immunity are less susceptible
-   $S_i$: scale infectiousness $\rightarrow$ people with immunity are less infectious
